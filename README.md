# Snake - A Simple Snake game made in Common Lisp

## Why Common Lisp?

Because I love Lisp and more specifically Common Lisp

## Why a game?

Because I'm not used to writing this kind of software and thought it would be fun

# Environment and dependencies

I use sbcl and quicklisp, and I'm using specific sbcl features, namely `sb-ext:get-time-of-day` and `sb-thread:make-thread`. I decided to use as few dependencies as I can to make it simple

For the UI this project uses [cl-tui](https://github.com/naryl/cl-tui)

# Build and run

See [Makefile](/Makefile)
